## The Ideas Repo     

I've created the [Ideas Repo](https://github.com/felipejsm/ideas), with the intention to keep track of my ideas for my personal projects.   
Simply put, a organizer for ideas.   

## The Voice
Uniting my love for music and restlessness regarding my career*, I want to build a auto-subtitle app?/lib?/software using [Google Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech/docs/basics).     

## The Spring 
Although I'm using it on regular basis at work was only after an interview test, I realize how handy this framework is.
Need to study/practice it more.

## The CRUD Maker*
I do not remember where I read it first time but the _'CRUD Programmer'_ title idea bugs me
Obviously, not gonna be a _idealistic programmer_, we all have bills to pay but it would be great to build something more _tricky/complex_.    
Need to make a blog post.

  - What a song to start an album! Jonny Craig with his powerful voice and a catchy chorus it's enough to cheer up your day.
