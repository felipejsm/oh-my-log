## The Strapi Examples     

I'm stuck with my strapi test repo because of an error that I'm having but knowing that I can submit my simple project to an official repo for example purposes, its gives me a mood booster.  

## The Toast UI Chart
Just founded this new chart project that has a good looking-and-feel and also seems pretty easy to use.     


## The Links
- [TUI Chart](http://ui.toast.com/tui-chart/)
- [Strapi List Example](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-examples)

## The Music

_Emo Mood_ - BR version:     

- [Tuyo -  Solamento + Amadurece e Apodrece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeVGtklLMRE)
  - Tuyo has been on my youtube recommendations a while now and I've never gave it a chance until today. Powerful voices and great lyrics. It's simply delicious to listen to it.
