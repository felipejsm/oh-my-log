## The WebSocket Study Part II   

I've found a github rep about [auttar websocket](https://github.com/felipejsm/auttar-sdk)

## The Checker
I follow this java twitter [account](https://twitter.com/java) and a tweet about this _checker_ got my attention     
I'll put it on my list of study, maybe I use it in some side project.    

## The Links
- [Auttar SDK](https://github.com/alexandreclayton/auttar-sdk)
- [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/)


## The Music

Stopped a little bit the _emo mood_ and the search for fresh bands today. Once again.   
Now a old but gold moment:
