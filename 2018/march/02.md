## The WebSocket Study    

Because of a task at my work, I have to study everything I can about websocket.     
After a previous _boring_ task, this one made me smile a bit :)     
Did a simple implementation with [echo](http://www.websocket.org/echo.html)  
Here it is: [my humble websocket implementation](http://my-websocket.surge.sh/)

## The Music

Stopped a little bit the _emo mood_ and the search for fresh bands today.    
I did a [lastfm account](https://www.last.fm/pt/user/felipe-moyses) and gave a particular band a second shot:     

- [The Ghost Inside - Avalanche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cASpchz2npg)
  - I've listened this band a few years ago and didn't pay to much attention. But now, I find it preeeetty good!
