## The Black magic with just HTML+CSS    

[Keith](https://keithclark.co.uk/) && [Roman](http://kizu.ru/en/)    

I've found these two web developer on twitter, and their work is amazing.    
One does a 3d demo game with HTML+CSS and the other one, a sortable html table with also only HTML+CSS.    
My jaw continues dropped down.    

## The Looking for a mock data for Java 
One million records of data.
In order to study Java Batch and Hibernate/EclipseLink best way to handle that amount of data, well...     
I need to generate it, somehow     
I did a research and founded two interesting solutions    
- Mockaroo (not completely free)
- jPopulator (OpenSource)
Even though, I'm going to keep researching for other solutions
## The Should I go to a Meetup?

## The Music

Continuing with the _emo mood_, I'm searching for fresh new post-hc/emo/melodic-hc bands and boy, Australia's doing a good job so far!

- [Love Alone - Iron Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9NqIvSbd7I)
  - directly from Melbourne - AUS, the band comes with a combo of melancholy and introspective lyrics, really good instrumental and an intense vocal. Great.     
- [Hindsight - LoveOver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us9FZWvRv4I)
  - Coming from Adelaide - AUS, they got me at this very song, what a passionate and aggressive sound, I just love it, the only problem is that they don't have a full length yet.
