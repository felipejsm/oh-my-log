## About Cool Tools and My Effort to Study

### The Cool
Canva it's a pretty handy and good looking (and free), design creator. I've used to build my Startup logo.
LogoDust provide pre-built logos for free, I saw some orgs/forums using it and it looked pretty good    

### The Effort
As a developer I can't afford to keep myself inside a comfort zone, I must push myself to cross my limits.   
I know it sounds _cliché_ but in the end, it's a cliché because it's true.   
I've a goal to continue my career as a developer overseas.   
So, I'm pushing myself to commit everyday, read everyday and practice everyday.  
But I'm not practicing everyday like I should, althought I have a beautiful baby boy to take care when I'm home, I won't allow myself to use it as an excuse.   
Maybe I need to give me some time to focus on my son but I believe that I must strive to do both.    
No excuses, that's it.

### Music    

I'm on my _emo mood_ these days, so, as expected, lot's of drama and emotion:

  - It's been a while since a guy and his guitar got my attention, I believe the last time it happened was with the almighty Dallas Green.
